# Pill Reminder Esp8266 Project
Basic Esp8266 project for my embedded systems lecture. <br/>

# Project Description: <br/>
  In this project, a system has been developed to regularly remind users of their pill intake times. The system tracks pill schedules using a real-time clock and, when the predetermined time is reached, it alerts the user through a buzzer and activates a servo motor to dispense a single pill from the tube to the patient. Once the process is completed, the system resets the timer and starts counting again. <br/> <br/>
